          Say Y here if you have any sensor device (mpu6xxx...)
          connected to your system and want it to be available to applications.
          Say N here if you have a headless (no mpu6xxx) system.
          If unsure, say Y.

config IIO_BUFFER

	  Provide core support for various buffer based data
	  acquisition methods.

config IIO_SW_RING
       select IIO_TRIGGER
	tristate "Industrial I/O lock free software ring"
	help
	  Example software ring buffer implementation.  The design aim
	  of this particular realization was to minimize write locking
	  with the intention that some devices would be able to write
	  in interrupt context.

config IIO_KFIFO_BUF
	select IIO_TRIGGER
	tristate "Industrial I/O buffering based on kfifo"
	help
	  A simple fifo based on kfifo.  Use this if you want a fifo
	  rather than a ring buffer. Note that this currently provides
	  no buffer events so it is up to userspace to work out how
	  often to read from the buffer.

config IIO_TRIGGER
	boolean "Enable triggered sampling support"
	help
	  Provides IIO core support for triggers.  Currently these
	  are used to initialize capture of samples to push into
	  ring buffers.  The triggers are effectively a 'capture
	  data now' interrupt.

config IIO_CONSUMERS_PER_TRIGGER
       int "Maximum number of consumers per trigger"
       depends on IIO_TRIGGER
       default "2"
       help
        This value controls the maximum number of consumers that a
        given trigger may handle. Default is 2.
